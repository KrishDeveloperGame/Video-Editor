# Video Editor

This is a application for an internship at Zersey.

What it does:
- 
1. Add text overlays to videos
2. Displays the videos you have edited in a feed.

The entire program was made programmatically without a storyboard.

NOTE: When in the editor view, tap anywheree (except the buttons) to launch the video picker.

Limitations:
- 

**The biggest limitation in this application is it CANNOT edit PORTRAIT VIDEOS.**

### Overlay Text

The defualt overlay text color is white.

The font size is set to 18 by defualt.


### Moving the Overlay Text

When you add overlay text, you have to drag the move label.

### Feed UI

The heart button doesn't do anything. 

### Overall UI

There may be few bugs here and there in the overall UI. Also the UI maynot be so great.

## Why limitations?

I am sorry for many limitations in the app. The major reason of limitations was I had very less time to make the app. I also didn't know how to use AVFoundation, so learning and making wasn't possible so quickly.
